> The way you code shapes the way you think. And the platform you choose shapes the coder you become.

CodeHat is a platform designed to provide a seamless and efficient coding environment in your browser. Run code with custom inputs, test algorithms, and experiment with logic without the overhead of a traditional IDE.

This repository contains the official **open-source frontend** for the CodeHat platform.

**Built for Coders, Open to Everyone. No Cost. No Catch. Just Code.**

## 🗺️ Roadmap

We are actively working to evolve CodeHat into a full-fledged platform. Our current focus is on building a robust and secure multi-language backend.

- [ ] **Containerized Backend**: Implementing Docker to create isolated and secure execution environments for user code.
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support**: Expanding beyond Python to include JavaScript, C++, Java, and Go.
- [ ] **User Accounts**: Allowing users to save their code snippets and history.
- [ ] **UI/UX Enhancements**: Continuously improving the user interface.
- [ ] **Backend Source**: Considering open-sourcing the backend in the future.
